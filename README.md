<h1>
Installation
</h1>

1. Navigate to the directory you extracted the zip to using the command prompt, then run "npm install" to download all of the dependencies.

2. Edit "config.json" & "faceitConfig.json" by replacing the empty strings with the relevant token / API key. You will have to sign up to the FACEIT developer portal and create an app, which only requires a FACEIT account to do. You will also have to use the Discord Developer Portal to gain a bot token, which is fairly easy to do.

3. Run "node bot.js" in the command prompt.

<h1>
Usage
</h1>

1. !faceit *username*

2. Usernames are case sensitive, the bot will message back an error if the letter casing is not correct.
